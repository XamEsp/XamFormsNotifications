Xamarin Forms Notifications

Using Xamarin.Forms

Goal
- Show some partial content on the screen
- over any existing page
- allow the user to interact with the existing page
- allow the user to navigate without losing the partial content

Tried

- Adding some content to the current page with different layouts, it's not working because the content is not longer available when the user navigate to another view
- Xamarin.form popup (no access to the existing page)

To try
- https://github.com/EgorBo/Toasts.Forms.Plugin
- Master / Detail adding to the master or detail?
